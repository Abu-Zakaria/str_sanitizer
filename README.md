## Usage

- To escape quotes of a string
  ```ruby
  require "str_sanitizer"

  hello = 'He said, "Hello!"'
  StrSanitizer.double_quote(hello) # => He said, \"Hello!\" 

  hello = "She said, 'Hello!'"
  StrSanitizer.single_quote(hello) # => She said, \'Hello!\'

  both_quotes = "They said, \"Don't do it!\""
  StrSanitizer.both_quotes(both_quotes) # => They said, \"Don\'t do it!\"
  ```
  You can also check if the string has any quote or not
  ```ruby
  no_quote = "Hello, there."
  single_quote = "It's going down."
  double_quote = "He said, \"Hello\""

  StrSanitizer.has_any_quote?(no_quote) # => nil
  StrSanitizer.has_both_quotes?(no_quote) # => nil

  StrSanitizer.has_single_quotes?(single_quote) # => true
  StrSanitizer.has_double_quotes?(double_quote) # => true
  ```

- To sanitize HTML Entities of a string
  ```ruby
  string = "<script>alert('Hola!!!')</script>"
